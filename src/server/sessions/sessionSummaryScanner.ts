/*
 * LISTING CONTRACT
 *
 * The summary fields mirror the SDK listing (`SessionManager.listAll`):
 * `messageCount` counts every `message` entry, `firstMessage` is the first
 * user message with non-empty text content, `name` is the latest `session_info`
 * name (an empty or missing name clears it), and `created`/`id`/`cwd`/
 * `parentSessionPath` come from the header line. Three deliberate differences:
 *
 * - `modified` is the file mtime rather than the last message timestamp.
 *   Session files are append-only, so the mtime is a faithful "last activity"
 *   for listing order, the only thing `modified` is used for.
 * - `allMessagesText` is always empty. Building it required parsing every
 *   message body — the cost this scanner exists to remove — and PI WEB never
 *   consumes it.
 * - `messageCount` can transiently include a final write read mid-flight: a
 *   message-shaped line that ends with `}` counts even though its JSON is
 *   never validated, where the SDK fails to parse such a torn line. The count
 *   self-heals on the next listing once the line completes (the file is
 *   re-scanned whole as soon as its size changes).
 *
 * Files whose header is missing, unreadable, or not a session header are
 * skipped, like the SDK does. Results are sorted by `modified` descending.
 *
 * Per-line work is minimal: lines are classified from their leading
 * `{"type":"..."` bytes without ever decoding them, and lines are only turned
 * into strings and JSON-parsed when they matter — the header, `session_info`
 * lines (rare, one per rename), and message lines until the first user text
 * message has been found. Message bodies after that point (which hold the huge
 * tool results and assistant replies) are neither decoded nor parsed.
 */

/**
 * Fast-path classification prefix of a session file line, as raw bytes.
 *
 * The Pi SDK writes every entry with `type` as the first JSON key, so the
 * entry type can normally be read directly from the line's first bytes without
 * decoding or parsing it. This is what lets a listing skip the (potentially
 * huge) message bodies entirely: only lines whose type actually matters for
 * the summary are ever decoded to strings and JSON-parsed.

/**
 * Session summary scanner with a per-file memo, so repeated listings of the

 * the listing contract above for the fields it produces.
 *
 * The memo is a last resort on top of the lightweight streaming scan and is
 * deliberately trivial to invalidate — it never holds anything the file
 * itself cannot re-derive:
 *
 * - Key: absolute file path, grouped by its directory so pruning one
 *   directory never walks another's entries. Trusted value: file identity
 *   (dev/ino) plus the size the cached summary was folded from.
 * - Identity and size unchanged → cached summary. The mtime is re-read from
 *   the same stat, so `modified` stays faithful even on a cache hit.
 * - Identity or size changed → the cached summary is dropped and the file is
 *   scanned whole again. Nothing is folded incrementally, so a warm listing
 *   is always the fold of exactly the bytes it read.
 * - File gone (ENOENT) → its entry is dropped; entries for files that no
 *   longer appear in the directory listing are pruned on each scan.
 * - {@link clear} drops every entry. There are no TTLs and nothing is
 *   persisted: the memo is an in-process speedup, and a daemon restart starts
 *   cold but correct. A read still in flight across {@link clear} or
 *   {@link invalidate} answers its own listing but is not memoized.
 * - Concurrent scans of one directory share work without serving stale
 *   results: a request made while a scan runs joins the one scan queued
 *   behind it, which starts only after the running scan settles.
 *
 * The one thing the key cannot detect is an in-place rewrite that keeps the
 * inode and the size, which the stat-only fast path then serves from the
 * memo. The SDK never rewrites session files, but PI WEB's detach does (it
 * clears the header), so callers that rewrite a file in place must call
 * {@link invalidate} for it; {@link clear} remains the escape hatch for
 * unknown external rewrites.
