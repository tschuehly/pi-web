/**
 * Session environment facts appended to every session's system prompt.
 *
 * Sessions run inside the session daemon, and everything an agent spawns —
 * the bash tool, terminals, subsessions — inherits the daemon's environment.
 * That inheritance is deliberate: `PI_WEB_SESSION=1` marks every spawned
 * process as nested inside this pi-web instance, the daemon's `PI_WEB_*`
 * wiring stays visible, and a second pi-web instance started with those
 * inherited values fails loudly at startup because the live instance owns the
 * state (see `sessiondStateOwnership`).
 *
 * The block tells the agent the nesting exists and which precautions follow,
 * so it learns the rules before discovering them by breaking its own session:
 * use a distinct data dir, socket, and ports for another instance; require an
 * explicit user override before stopping or restarting the hosting daemon;
 * and restart the web/API process before the session daemon. It also asks for
 * file references as Markdown links, which the Chat opens as workspace files.
