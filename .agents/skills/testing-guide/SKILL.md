# Testing guide

Use this skill for test-specific decisions in this repository. The goal is useful regression coverage without letting test helpers, mocks, or component harnesses become a second application that is harder to maintain than the code under test.

For production-code design and testability seams, also use the `code-quality-architecture` skill. This guide owns test strategy, test helper conventions, and UI test escape hatches.

## Core principles

- Test behavior and contracts that matter, not branches for their own sake.
- Prefer the smallest layer that proves the behavior: pure helper, service, controller, route/API contract, component boundary, then broader integration.
- Keep tests deterministic. Fake clocks, browser globals, filesystem/process/network boundaries, and hard-to-trigger errors when needed.
- Assert observable outcomes: return values, state transitions, emitted calls/events, HTTP responses, rendered user-facing state, or durable side effects.
- Avoid asserting incidental implementation details unless the selected gap is specifically about that implementation contract.
- Keep setup readable. A small explicit fixture is better than a magical factory that hides the scenario.
- Clean up global stubs, fake timers, DOM state, and pending promises so tests do not leak into one another.

## Decide whether a test adds protection

Use three questions when adding or reviewing a test:

1. What meaningful failure does it catch?
2. What protection does it add beyond existing tests, required delivery steps, or normal usage?
3. What is the smallest boundary that proves the invariant?

Apply these as a review habit:

- Give each invariant one primary owner. For example, test validation cases at the service boundary and use a route test to prove HTTP wiring.
- Assign compilation to typecheck/build and packaging contracts to delivery checks against already-built artifacts, such as public declarations and deployment URLs.
- Rely on normal usage for obvious, recoverable workflow failures it reliably exposes. Automate protection where failures can escape notice, especially security, durable state, resource cleanup, and uncommon supported deployments.
- Use real processes, sockets, or browsers when their behavior is the invariant; for example, verify process termination with a real child process.
- Treat feedback time and fixture complexity as maintenance costs. Review slow additions and periodically consolidate overlapping coverage, preserving each meaningful invariant at its chosen boundary.
- Prefer small explicit fixtures and controllable collaborators. Keep review proportional to the change rather than adding mandatory forms or new testing infrastructure.

## Choosing the test layer

Prefer this order unless the behavior requires a higher layer:

1. **Pure helper/service tests** for data shaping, validation, cache decisions, command construction, and conversion logic.
2. **Controller/runtime adapter tests** for state orchestration, endpoint selection, cancellation, timers, and injected collaborators.
3. **Route/API contract tests** for HTTP status mapping, path/query/body parsing, proxy allowlists, and compatibility contracts.
4. **Component-boundary tests** for UI event wiring and rendered state. Prefer real DOM/custom-element interaction via the per-file happy-dom harness (see Lit component tests).
5. **Broad verification** (`npm run verify`) when a change is cross-cutting, changes shared helpers/types, or before final merge review.

Do not jump to a broad UI or integration test just because it feels more realistic if a lower layer proves the same behavior with less noise and less flake risk.

## Test helpers and fakes

- Keep helpers local until reuse is clear. If a pattern appears in multiple files, consolidate deliberately rather than copy-pasting variants.
- Type helpers and fakes strictly; avoid `any` unless the test is intentionally modeling an untyped external boundary.
- Fake only the boundary needed for the scenario. Do not mock the unit under test or so many collaborators that the assertion stops proving real behavior.
- Prefer controllable promises, fake timers, and explicit injected dependencies over sleeps or timing guesses.
- Name helpers after the domain behavior they support, not the mechanics of the fake.

## Lit component tests

Test Lit components through public/component boundaries, choosing the narrowest seam that proves the behavior, in this order:

1. **Pure exported seam** for content, ordering, and composition logic: extract an exported pure function from the component (for example `sessiondPanelNotices` or `chatQueuedMessageSections`) and test that, rather than scraping rendered output.
2. **happy-dom harness** for rendered state and real user-like interaction (see below).
3. **TemplateResult handler extraction** only as a narrow legacy escape hatch (see its rule below).

### happy-dom harness

`happy-dom` is the standard DOM environment for Lit component tests. It is a declared devDependency, opted into per file with a docblock on the first line of the test file:

```ts
// @vitest-environment happy-dom
```

Keep the opt-in per file; never set a global `environment` in `vitest.config.ts`. Pure logic tests stay on the fast default node environment, and only DOM-touching tests pay the harness cost.

Use the harness for what the node environment cannot provide and the extraction escape hatch forbids: rendered shadow-DOM state, real events (`click()`, `dispatchEvent`), focus and `activeElement`, native form semantics (radio/checkbox grouping, `checked`), and ARIA wiring such as `aria-describedby` or `aria-live`. Instantiate the component, set properties per its contract, append it to `document.body`, and interact with the rendered controls instead of invoking Lit handlers.

happy-dom is not a browser. Do not assert layout, styling, visual state, real scroll geometry, or `IntersectionObserver`/`ResizeObserver` behavior with it. Stub missing APIs at the boundary — spy on `Element.prototype.scrollIntoView`, stub `window.matchMedia` — and assert the calls, not geometry.

Conventions:

- Clean up in `afterEach`: `document.body.replaceChildren()` and `localStorage.clear()` so DOM and storage state do not leak between tests.
- Await `element.updateComplete` after property changes or events before asserting; await it twice when the component schedules another render from within `updated()`, so any follow-up render has settled.
- Assert user-visible rendered state or controller calls caused by the interaction, not Lit internals.

### TemplateResult event-handler extraction rule

Lit `TemplateResult` event-handler extraction means calling `render()`, inspecting the returned template's `strings`/`values`, finding an event handler near a marker, and invoking that handler directly. It is a legacy escape hatch, not the default: with the happy-dom harness available, the "render harness impractical" precondition below rarely holds, so rule out the pure-seam and happy-dom options before reaching for extraction.

Use TemplateResult handler extraction only when all of these are true:

1. The test is specifically verifying Lit template event wiring.
2. A happy-dom render would add disproportionate setup, flakiness, or noise for the behavior being checked — rare now that the harness exists, so justify it in the required comment.
3. The assertion checks observable component/controller effects, not Lit internals.
4. The lookup is anchored to stable semantic markup, labels, or user-facing text rather than incidental handler order.
5. The test stays narrow; it is not trying to cover a full user flow, accessibility behavior, or visual/layout behavior.

Do not use TemplateResult handler extraction for:

- general content assertions;
- styling, layout, focus, keyboard navigation, or accessibility behavior;
- broad user flows where real DOM events are the point;
- scenarios with an existing public controller/service/helper seam;
- copying a new ad hoc helper variant into another file without reviewing whether the shared helper or the happy-dom harness is now warranted.

When using this escape hatch:

- Add a short comment above the helper or test explaining why direct handler extraction is proportionate.
- Prefer the shared, type-guarded helpers in `src/client/src/templateInspection.testSupport.ts`; keep any genuinely file-specific lookup small and type-guarded rather than copying new variants.
- Anchor searches to stable semantic markers such as accessible labels, button text, ids intentionally used by the component, or nearby form markup.
- Assert the behavior caused by the handler, such as state changes or calls to injected callbacks/controllers.
- Avoid assertions about the exact shape of Lit's private data beyond the minimum needed to find the handler; fail with clear errors if the template cannot be inspected.

Existing extraction tests are acceptable as-is. Convert them to a pure seam or the happy-dom harness opportunistically when the file is touched for other reasons; do not run a big-bang migration.

## End-to-end browser checks

`npm run test:e2e` runs the Playwright specs in `e2e/` in WebKit, the engine of the macOS app's WKWebView. `e2e/isolatedPiWeb.ts` builds the bundled plugins and client, then starts a throwaway session daemon and web/API server. They get their own temp data dir, socket, port and Pi agent dir, and every inherited `PI_*` variable is dropped. The server is seeded with a fixture project and a finished Chat, so no model call is needed, and it is torn down afterwards. Reserve e2e specs for flows that need a real browser and a real server together. They stay out of Vitest's include globs.

## Checks to run

Delivery artifact checks are separate from the ordinary suite: run `npm run build` followed by `npm run check:artifacts` when changing emitted package contracts. The latter consumes the existing `dist` output and never refreshes it. See [development and delivery checks](../../../docs/development-checks.md) for check ownership.

Run the narrowest meaningful check first:

- Changed test file: `npm test -- --run <test-file>`.
- Source or exported type changes: also run `npm run typecheck`.
- Non-trivial test helper, component, or lint-sensitive changes: run `npx eslint <changed-file>` or `npm run lint` when broader lint coverage is needed.
- Cross-cutting changes or final merge review: prefer `npm run verify`.

Record exact commands and results when working under relay/audit workflows or when handing work to another agent.
